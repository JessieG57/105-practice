                <h4>Keep Going</h4>
                <p>It's true that one step starts a journey.  Have you ever thought you were too old to do something, and then found yourself in the same position years later?  Just start.  It's the only way to get where you want to go.</p>

                <h4>Confusion</h4>
                <p>Tony Robbins says that when you are confused, it means you are open to a new way of doing something.</p>
 
                <p>So, if you or someone you love is "confused" about how they feel, ask "what can we do differently"?</p>
